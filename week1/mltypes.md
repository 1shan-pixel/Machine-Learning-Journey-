## Supervised Learning : 

Input -> Output Mappings

### Learns based on giving a certain amount of right answers. 

Eg : spam filtering, speech recongnition , online advertising, housing prices prediction

Common ideas : Regression(choosing the best fit line, prediciting a number from infinitely many possible outputs)  Classification (choosing one output based on two possible outputs(generally two, can be more than two, generally two or more inputs are utilized to produce an output in classification))

---

## Unsupervised Learning 

The task here it figure out some patterns hidden within the data. 
Data comes with input label x but not with output label y 
Also helps in dimensionality reduction.

Eg : Gropuing customers based on common spending habits, Anamoly detection.
