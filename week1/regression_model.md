# Linear Regression Model 

Fitting a straight line to data and prediciting an outcome. 

Helpful to visualize if there's a data table in linear regression. 

Training set : Data used to train the model.    

input : feature 
output : target 

## Linear Regression of one Variable 

y = mx + b , this equation best represents linear regression 

Here, m(w) and b are the parameters. 

w = 
b = 

Univariate Linear Regression , only one input variable (x)

## Cost Function : 

Sum of squared error across the dataset. 

Cost function  = sum across m data sets((y^ - y )^2 )/2m // 2m to ensure that cost function doesnt increase with increased number of data sets. 

Cost functions generally denoted by J(w,b). Generally the goal of linear regrression is to minimize the cost function.
